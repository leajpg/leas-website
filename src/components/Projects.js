              You are here!üìç This website was crafted with React.js and React
              Routing. I added my own pixel art and CSS animations to give it a
              personal touch. Drawing inspiration from y2k web aesthetics and
              Geocities designs, I aimed to create a responsive, modern, and
              uniquely engaging platform to showcase my work and interests. View

              I created a Weather App using React.js to showcase my proficiency
              using APIs. For this project I utilized OpenWeatherMap to create a
              responsive application where the user can type in their city and
              see the current weather. I also include my own digital pixel art
              to create a unique design and user interface. Please note this
              project's design is still a work in progress.{" "}
